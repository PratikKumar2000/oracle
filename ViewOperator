View pushed predicates -> may have seen in execution plan happens when we push the predicates of outer query inside the inner query to make performance better.

like say we have the query as
select e.first_name, e.last_name, dept_locs.address
from employees e,
() dept_locs
where dept_locs.department_id = e.deparment_id;

To let oracle use the index on department_id it will push this outer predicate inside.


CODE: View Operator
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, dept_locs_v.street_address,
       dept_locs_v.postal_code
FROM   employees e,
      ( SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name, 
               l.street_address, l.postal_code
        FROM   departments d, locations l
        WHERE  d.location_id = l.location_id ) dept_locs_v
