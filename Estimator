There are 2 ways of estimation one explained in the course is COST BASED OPTIMIZATION but there is another one called as RULE BASED OPTIMIZATION.
Rule based optimization is an old way of doing where there is following of some rules like use an index in some kind of operations or make a full search in some kind of operations.
However it is not accurate so oracle moved to cost based optimization.

Cost Based Optimization has some kind of levels ->
* FIRST_ROWS
* FIRST_ROWS_N
* ALL_ROWS

Reason: the aim of optimizer is best throughput.
Sometimes we do not want to see all the roww sometimes on highly interactive applications like oracle forms, etc. so we look for first few rows immediately.
The optimizer will return first few rows and on demand can load the other rows.

** By default optimization is set all rows but we can change that but it will change for entire session. **

So if it is set to all rows or first rows the optimizer can decide different operations for a specific action. If it is set to all rows then optimizer returns all rows at a time 
to memory.

-----------------------------------------------
Defining the optimization level (such as ALL_ROWS or FIRST_ROWS) in an Oracle execution plan tells the SQL optimizer what kind of performance goal you want for your query:

ALL_ROWS:

The optimizer tries to minimize total resource consumption and return all rows as efficiently as possible.
Best for batch jobs, reports, or queries where you need the complete result set.
FIRST_ROWS (n):

The optimizer tries to return the first n rows as quickly as possible, even if the total query takes longer.
Best for interactive applications or web pages where the user wants to see the first few results quickly.
In summary:
Setting the optimization level helps the database choose the best execution plan for your use caseâ€”either fastest overall completion (ALL_ROWS) or fastest initial response (FIRST_ROWS).
----------------------------------------------

But for some we can see in execution plan table or the dbms.xplan that there is optimizer column mentioning analyzed means the statistics are available for that object
so need to go for dynamic sampling.

**** Dynamic Sampling means taking some candidate rows and generating the statistics based on these rows. ****
